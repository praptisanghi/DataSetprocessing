# Python Classifier Project

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning classifier using Python. The classifier is designed to distinguish between fault and no-fault data based on provided features.

## Introduction
This project uses a Random Forest classifier to classify data into fault and no-fault categories based on two feature values. The project includes data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
```
classifier_project/
├── fault_classifier.py
├── Fault.xlsx
├── NoFault.xlsx
├── README.md
```

- `fault_classifier.py`: The main script that loads the data, preprocesses it, trains the model, and evaluates its performance.
- `Fault.xlsx`: Excel file containing fault data.
- `NoFault.xlsx`: Excel file containing no-fault data.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dependencies
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `openpyxl`

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn openpyxl
```

## Running the Code
1. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Ensure that the `Fault.xlsx` and `NoFault.xlsx` files are in the same directory as `fault_classifier.py`.
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python fault_classifier.py
   ```

## Explanation of the Code
The script performs the following steps:

1. **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.
2. **Load Data**: Load data from Excel files into pandas DataFrames.
3. **Labeling Data**: Add a new column, `label`, to distinguish between fault (1) and no-fault (0) data.
4. **Combine Data**: Concatenate the fault and no-fault datasets into a single DataFrame.
5. **Rename Columns**: Rename columns for easier access and clarity.
6. **Feature and Label Selection**: Select features (`value_one` and `value_two`) and labels (`label`).
7. **Handle Missing Values**: Fill any missing values in the features with the mean of the respective columns.
8. **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using `train_test_split` with `random_state=42` to ensure reproducibility.
9. **Normalization**: Normalize the feature data using `StandardScaler`.
10. **Model Initialization**: Initialize a Random Forest classifier with 100 trees and `random_state=42`.
11. **Model Training**: Train the model on the training data.
12. **Making Predictions**: Make predictions on the test data.
13. **Model Evaluation**: Calculate and print the accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.

## Results
When running the script, you will see output similar to the following:

```
Model Accuracy: 100.00%

Classification Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       1.00      1.00      1.00         5
           1       1.00      1.00      1.00         7

    accuracy                           1.00        12
   macro avg       1.00      1.00      1.00        12
weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00        12

Confusion Matrix:
[[5 0]
 [0 7]]
```

- **Model Accuracy**: Shows the overall accuracy of the model.
- **Classification Report**: Provides detailed performance metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Displays the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
