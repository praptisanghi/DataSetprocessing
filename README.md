## Introduction
This project uses a Random Forest classifier to classify data into fault and no-fault categories based on two feature values. The project includes data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `fault_classifier.py`: The main script that loads the data, preprocesses it, trains the model, and evaluates its performance.
- `Fault.xlsx`: Excel file containing fault data.
- `NoFault.xlsx`: Excel file containing no-fault data.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dependencies
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `openpyxl`

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:
```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn openpyxl

This `README.md` provides a clear overview of the classifier project, including instructions for running the code and an explanation of the results. It ensures that users can understand and replicate the project easily.
